## PROJECT NOTES

* not 100% sold on using the .data directory and just using files to save user data
* i figure that we should be using a database
* and so i wanted to finde something super common but also super generic
* thought that mysql was a good idea, but would really have to use the npm module for mysql to make it work
* hmmmm... so much for doing everything from scratch (maybe everything from scratch is impractical)
* so if i search how to programmatically connect to mysql i find that almost every language has a module to do it
